Here we will only summarize the main abstract mechanisms and assumptions behind the blackboard architecture. For a deep review we recommend to read recently published circuit design and examples that focus on sentence processing \cite{de2015combinatorial} alongside the original framework proposal for combinatorial structures in cognition \cite{van_der_Velde_2006}.

The blackboard assumes grounded representations of concepts in a distributed or local neural population (main assemblies, MA), while binding of concepts is represented through the conditional activity of neural populations mimicking working memory dynamics (working memory assemblies, WM). So in the case of sentence processing we can think of the grammatical categories as the grounded concepts and of their corresponding syntax tree as a process realized through the conditional activity in the working memory circuits.

Lets consider the simplest case of binding two grammatical categories. This takes place in one "compartment circuit" of a "connection matrix". The compartment circuit contains the connection node WM, that itself can be interpreted as a typed edge between the grammatical category nodes under a dependency grammar formalism or as another grammatical category in itself under a phrase structure grammar formalism.

The compartment circuit is engineered with an appropriate combination of simple "gating circuits". So the gating circuit can be seen as the smallest meaningful circuit in a blackboard architecture, composed of interconnected neural populations.

Then "A blackboard", the complete blackboard architecture, is a set of connection matrices. Where each connection matrix represents the memory capacity for the dynamic binding of two specific grammatical categories and manages memory slots dynamically through competing mutually inhibitory WM nodes.
