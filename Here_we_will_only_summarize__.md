Here we will only summarize the main abstract mechanisms and assumptions behind the blackboard architecture. For a deep review we recommend to read recently published circuit design and examples that focus on sentence processing \cite{de2015combinatorial} alongside the original framework proposal for combinatorial structures in cognition \cite{van_der_Velde_2006}.

The blackboard assumes grounded representations of concepts in a distributed or local neural populations (main assemblies, MA), while binding of concepts is represented through the conditional activity of neural populations mimicking working memory dynamics (working memory assemblies, WM). So in the case of sentence processing we can think of the grammatical categories as the grounded concepts and of their corresponding syntax tree as a process realized through the conditional activity in the working memory circuits.

Lets consider the simplest case of binding two grammatical categories. This takes place in one "compartment circuit" of a "connection matrix". The compartment circuit contains neural populations that encode the relationship type of the binding (sub assemblies, SA) and the WM keeps the binding for an arbitrary period of time. It is engineered with six simple "gating circuits". The gating circuit can be seen as the smallest meaningful circuit in a blackboard architecture, composed of interconnected neural assemblies such that neural activation is transferred conditionally between a source and target neural assemblies. Thanks to this, the compartment circuit is allows bidirectional communication between the MA encoding the grounded representation of the grammatical categories mediated by a neural control mechanism. Then "A blackboard", the complete blackboard architecture, is a set of connection matrices. Where each connection matrix represents the memory capacity for the dynamic binding of two specific grammatical categories and manages memory slots dynamically through competing mutually inhibitory compartment circuits. Detailed diagrams of the blackboard architecture can be seen in Figure \ref{Blackboard}.

the realization of trees how to interpret them... WM can dependency grammars... can extend the WM to a MA to allow hierarchical constructions like in phrase structure grammars.
