# Introduction

The proposal of the blackboard

The problems tackled by the blackboard

Quick Implications on neural circuit design (summary)

Previous attempts to simulate the blackboard

Problems simulated
dependency grammar
ambiguity resolution
garden paths

how the blackboard was implemented
will allow comparison with what I have done

Notes on other circuit attempts for language

Population density techniques. VS the other mean equations.

The oscilatory behavior of kickstarting and the usefulness of including baseline activity (baseline activity references missing)

Excitatory Inhibitory balance, how it helps keep the circuit stability. The problems of information transmission, long chains of neural populations are costly. (references missing)
