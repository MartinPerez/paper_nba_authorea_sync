with population density methods and restrict ourselves only for the simulation of the mechanisms responsible for the representation of a composed structure.

LIF populations

Firing rates

Synaptic efficacy

issues encountered on oscillatory behavior, accounted by near threshold firing with baseline activity and smoothing rate activity increase

Diagram of actual circuit with parameters and rates

Plot of activation example for all time series. Legend for selected time series. And Plot of total activation of circuit.

Example activation for a right branch tree the same as above but summing across all cells. Moreover introducing groupings of populations.

Preparation of data for Bold-fMRI. Example plot of hemodynamics on same plot as above, Overlapped to emphasize difference in time scales of responses.
