# Neural simulations

## LIF neurons

## Population density techniques. VS the other mean equations.

## The oscilatory behavior of kickstarting and the usefulness of including baseline activity (baseline activity references missing)

## Excitatory Inhibitory balance, how it helps keep the circuit stability. The problems of information transmission, long chains of neural populations are costly. (references missing)
