Simpcomp background


Simpcomp experimental design


Simpcomp questions and results (mainly group results)

+ combinatorial activity ([noun|verb]_phrase_[2-4] - [noun|verb]_list_[2-4]). Contrast vs prediction in ROIs and language localizer (lexical access effects, working memory effects and lexical variability of preceding item as supposed to be controlled)

+ combinatorial activity sanity check ([noun|verb]_phrase_[1|5] - [noun|verb]_list_[1|5]) Should give no activation difference.

+ In ANOVA, check interaction between structure [phrase|list] and level [1-5].

+ Check other main effects and details in ANOVA.

+ Does model change if we model apart consonant strings (employ ridge to manage correlated regressors). Does a sanity check contrast between this regressors return back a similar image to language localizer... it should...

+ Check FIR model for the phrases profile of activation with different levels. Check possible delay misspecifications. Could we order ROIS in language localizer according to a peak time pattern?

+ Check nonlinear fitted function \cite{Wager_2005} on list conditions and phrase conditions. It could be that list and phrase conditions exhibit nonlinear increase in activations at different rates or in different phrase moments (This could be a clear indicator of composition even though both lists and phrases increase activation). Also it could be that linear increase signal encoding of a particular item or combination of items. Important to visualize distribution of beta magnitude change patterns in the ROIs and not only the beta magnitudes.
