Simpcomp experimental design


Simpcomp questions and results
+ combinatorial activity ([noun|verb]_phrase_[2-4] - [noun|verb]_list_[2-4]). Contrast vs prediction in ROIs and language localizer (lexical access effects, working memory effects and lexical variability of preceding item as supposed to be controlled)

+ combinatorial activity sanity check ([noun|verb]_phrase_[1|5] - [noun|verb]_list_[1|5]) Should give no activation difference.

+ In ANOVA, check interaction between structure [phrase|list] and level [1-5].

+ Check FIR model for the phrases profile of activation with different levels.

+ Check nonlinear fitted function \cite{Wager_2005} on list conditions and phrase conditions. It could be that list and phrase conditions exhibit nonlinear increase in activations at different rates or in different phrase moments (This could be a clear indicator of composition even though both lists and phrases increase activation). Also it could be that linear increase signal encoding of a particular item or combination of items. Important to visualize distribution of beta magnitude change patterns in the ROIs and not only the beta magnitudes.
