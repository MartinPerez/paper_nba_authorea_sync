### Complete sentence processing simulation

Duration of WM delay... can be anything, here taken pragmatically from necessary time to process complete 4 word sentences with 200ms words separated by 400 ms blanks....

Control delay considered 50ms after target word for 100ms, very naive version of xxx parsing. important to have in mind that there are other parsing possibilities. Look into generalized left corner parsing of Hale.

Example activation for a right branch tree the same as above but summing across all cells. Moreover introducing groupings of populations.

Preparation of data for Bold-fMRI. Example plot of hemodynamics on same plot as above, Overlapped to emphasize difference in time scales of responses.

Time series correlations and convolution analysis (asking for ridge later on)
