## Quick Implications on neural circuit design (summary)

## Previous attempts to simulate the blackboard

+ Problems simulated
+ dependency grammar
+ ambiguity resolution
+ garden paths

## how the blackboard was implemented
will allow comparison with what I have done

## Notes on other circuit attempts for language
