### Compartment circuit specification

Previous simulations of the blackboard approximate the mean activity of neural assemblies with Wilson Cowan dynamics \cite{Frank_2014} \cite{de2015combinatorial}. Nonetheless direct simulations of LIF neurons have faster transient behavior than the pseudo dynamics described by the Wilson Cowan equations, which only allow to approximate correctly the steady state of neural populations by suggesting what firing rates should be after certain period of time, as explained by De Kamps \cite{de_Kamps_2008}. 

We consider that given the quick nature of sentence parsing and 

with population density methods and restrict ourselves only for the simulation of the mechanisms responsible for the representation of a composed structure. The latest simulations use Cowan  and \cite{de2015combinatorial},, arguments against Cowan in stat\cite{de_Kamps_2008}... then we simulate LIF and take advange of population density techniques developed by De Kamps\cite{de2013generic} and implemented in the software MIIND\cite{de_Kamps_2008}\cite{harrison2011new}...

LIF populations. As a first approach, although conductance models are desirable and should eventually be implemented under population density methods as mentioned in \cite{de2013generic}

Simplify modeling of WM as a delay circuit instead of modeling it explicitly with neural populations. This is done as a first approximation but should be replaced for an actual circuit. Nonetheless there are many ways to implement the same qualitative behavior, not sure how to justify this...

We do not consider SAs as reverberating neural populations like is the case of WM, since the way we consider control activation makes it unnecessary. Contrary to our argmunets on \cite{velde2015ambiguity}. We model MA separately from a WM that leads its activation.
