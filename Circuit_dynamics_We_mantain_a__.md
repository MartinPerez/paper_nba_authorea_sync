### Circuit dynamics

We mantain a rate of activity transmission with the number of connections. Our simple approach ignore the intrincacies found in different regimes to transmit information in enural networks, where some regimes might allow rich internal computations. \cite{Ostojic_2014}. We simply focus on passing forward mean activity to be able to instantiate binding with WM activation.

issues encountered on oscillatory behavior, accounted by near threshold firing with baseline activity and smoothing rate activity increase



Control noise resilience can be shown in case controls get activated, baseline levels do not activate WM.

two MA activity necessary for WM activated. Otherwise it does not activate. Can show plot.

MA active creates elevated levels of activity in SA that would facilitate information flow and WM further prolonged activity.

To improve the future circuit implementation more realistic rest state of the network could have been achieved by balanced networks\cite{Wolf_2014}. This is a future expansion too. Also it might be desirable to move to more realistic network models like conductance? and implement dynamic synaptic efficacy enhancement during processing?
