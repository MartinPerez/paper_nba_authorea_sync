### The blackboard and Simpcomp stimuli

The Simpcomp experimental design contains phrases and word lists with 1 to 4 words. In the case of phrases there are two main categories, verb and noun phrases. Nonetheless all phrases are controlled to follow a right branched tree structure under a phrasal grammar theory.

We show in Figure \ref{phrase_activity} The simulated blackboard activity for phrases and list of words. GKs and Gs that form part of WM binding or that are influenced by Ctl were separated into inner and outer circuit categories respectively, since they show different qualitative behaviors.

MAs sudden burst due to bindings... outer Gs driven completely by control while outer GKs importantly activated by SAs after binding is realized in WM. internal GKs importantly suppressed by WM while internal Gs follow the same pattern of activity as SAs after binding is done due to closed circuit that is formed..

In the case of list of words is possible to see that MAs only drive outer GKs and the rest of compartment circuits stays mostly silent as expected.
