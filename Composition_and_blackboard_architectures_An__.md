# Composition and blackboard architectures

An important current issue in linguistic composition is to assess the biological neural circuitry that could be responsible for its dynamics and the associated syntactic representations. The simplicity of the SimpComp trials, that can be hypothesized as size increasing right branched trees under phrase structure grammars for both noun and verb phrases, give us the opportunity to evaluate simple predictions.

One promising approach is the blackboard architecture circuits detailed by Van der Velde and De Kamps\cite{van_der_Velde_2006}. As explained by the authors, the architecture deals simultaneously with several important issues raised by Jackendoff to model language processes\cite{Jackendoff_2002}.
