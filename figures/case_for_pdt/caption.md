\label{pdt_case} Case for population density techniques over Wilson Cowan dynamics.

Figure 2.11: Transient reponse for
rate-based and population density
dynamics (μ = 0.0195, σ = 0.001 mV).
The population density method shows
much larger transients, but the steady
state response is nearly the same

Figure 1.3: A histogram of the mem-
brane potential for each neuron in the
population at t = 0.3 s in the sim-
ulation. The solid line is the density
function of the population predicted
by population density techniques.
Within the statistics there is excellent
agreement.

Figure 1.2: The population firing rate
as calculated from the NEST simulation
(markers), and predicted by population
density techniques (solid line).

This scenario can just as well be modeled using population den-
sity techniques. When the spikes from Figure 1.1 are stored in a
histogram, they can be converted to a Apopulation firing rate. This
firing rate can also be calculated using population density techniques.
The results is shown in Figure 1.2: the markers indicate the firing
rates calculated from the NEST simulation with the error bars indi-
cating the statistical error due to the finite number of events in each
bin. The solid line is population density prediction. Within the statis-
tical error there is perfect agreement.
