\label{pdt_case} Case for population density techniques over Wilson Cowan dynamics.

(Plots taken from Marcs Manual). A. Shows the mean firing rate of a neural population simulated with Wilson Cowan dynamics labeled as a rate based model and a population density technique (μ = 0.0195, σ = 0.001 mV). One can see that the steady state of the population activity converge in time but that the transient dynamics are importantly different. B. Histogram of the membrane potential for each neuron in the population density technique simulation shown in A at time 0.3. The solid line corresponds to the prediction of the population density technique while the red markers correspond to error bars due to finite sample sizes in a simulation performed with NEST where each neuron is simulated separately. C. The jump response of the neural population according to the NEST simulation and the population density technique. It is possible to appreciate complete agreement within the boundaries of statistical error.
