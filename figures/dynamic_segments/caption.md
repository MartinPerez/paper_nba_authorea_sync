\label{dynamic_segments} Compartment Circuit segments of neural dynamics on binding activity profile

The four segments of dynamic neural activity in a compartment circuit, that would simplify blackboard simulations, are represented by the opaque yellow rectangles covering segments of the binding activity profile.
