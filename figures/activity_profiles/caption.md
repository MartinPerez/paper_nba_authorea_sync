\label{activity_profiles} Profiles of neural activity

A. Neural activation driven only by baseline input. B. Neural activation of the circuit when only one MA is activated by a word event or WM at 500ms. Portrays the neural activity related to an erroneous control signal at 850ms. Its possible to see that the steady state of neural activity is resilient to a slip of control, going to the appropriate levels of neural activity once the control activity is over.  C. Neural activity of the Compartment Circuit for a successful binding. The second MA gets activated at 800ms followed by the controls at 850ms. Since both MAs are active, the SAs manage to activate WM to instantiate the binding of the MAs. Two interesting dynamics arise from the binding. The first is that a spike of activity in SAs, GKs and Gs takes place due to the sudden inhibitory activity of WM on the GKs. The second is that the circuit internally raises its baseline activity.
